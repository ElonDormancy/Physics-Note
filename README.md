# About

![image](https://github.com/ElonDormancy/Physics-Note/blob/master/Feynman.jpg)

Hello! I am a student major in physics.Above is my idol Richard Feynman and I recommand you to learn more about him.I have learned much from him and hope to be a physicist like him.Not only be a master of physics but also be interested in art !

This is Physics notes summary Summarize by myself but still exists many errors and I will correct it further,The note almost about the quantum computation,and some other learning notes of myself.

And I will update my learning notes on github with some thinking

If you want to read my note on the github you must install some extension to render latex math equation

such as MathJax Plugin for Github

Hope my note will help you !

If you have any question you can contact me in [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/shen-dang-fu-mu-xin-xiang-qing-hua)
